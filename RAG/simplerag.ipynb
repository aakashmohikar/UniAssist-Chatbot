In order to award NC\\xa0State credit, we must receive an official Certificate or Certifying Statement via postal mail or courier in a Cambridge sealed envelope. You can find our mailing address here. Please visit the Cambridge website to request your certificate once it is available.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nFor U.S. exam takers:\\n\\nPlease visit the Cambridge website to request your certificate to be shared with us once it is available using their Grade Transcript Service.\\xa0\\nThere is a $17 fee per transcript paid by the student.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe department to which you have been admitted and Registration and Records will review the scores to determine how credit is to be awarded. View our credit opportunities for AS/A-level results here. Currently, only Cambridge A and AS level grades are considered for credit opportunities.\\nWhat is conditional admission?\\nIf you are interested in studying at NC\\xa0State as an undergraduate student and are academically competitive, but don’t have the minimum required TOEFL/IELTS/Duolingo score for full admission, conditional admission may be an option for you.\\nThere is no separate application process for conditional admission. You will apply for undergraduate admission through the regular process, and if you meet the criteria for conditional admission, you will be automatically considered.\\nStudents who are conditionally admitted to NC\\xa0State study in the Intensive English Program (IEP) before entering their academic programs. After completing the IEP, conditionally admitted students proceed to their major without having to take an additional TOEFL/IELTS/Duolingo.\\nHow many semesters do I need to stay in the Intensive English Program (IEP) before being admitted to NC\\xa0State University?\\nIt will depend on the result of the placement exam, but generally students spend one to four semesters in the program. There are four levels in the IEP, and it usually takes one semester to complete a level.\\nAs a conditionally admitted student, if I provide NC\\xa0State with a new TOEFL, IELTS, or Duolingo score that meets the full admission requirement, do I still need to complete the IEP?\\nYes, you must still complete the IEP. Once a student accepts the offer of conditional admission to NC\\xa0State, he/she has made an agreement with the University and the Office of Undergraduate Admissions to fulfill the conditions of admission.\\xa0 To fulfill the condition of admission, a student must successfully complete the IEP.\\nA submission of a new TOEFL, IELTS, or Duolingo score will not exempt conditionally admitted students from completing the IEP.\\xa0 It is true that a higher score on a standardized test does indicate improved English proficiency.\\xa0 However, student performance in an IEP is a better predictor over time of a student’s ability to successfully use English in an academic environment.\\nIs there an undecided major option for transfer applicants?\\nThere is not an undecided major option for transfer applicants. Transfer applicants must select a specific major on the application. View all majors here.\\nWhat first-year programs does NC\\xa0State offer?\\nFirst-year applicants have the opportunity to explore major options through one of our unique first-year programs.
